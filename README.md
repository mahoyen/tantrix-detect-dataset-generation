# Tantrix Detect Dataset Generation

Repository to create a dataset for computer vision.
A lot of code is taken from [this repo](https://github.com/geaxgx/playing-card-detection) which was my original inspiration.

[maintest.ipynb](https://github.com/mahoyen/new-tantrix-detect/blob/master/maintest.ipynb) is where most of the dataset creation is.

The computer vision part is done in [this repo](https://github.com/mahoyen/trantix-detect).
